**treeheatr** displays a more interpretable decision tree visualization by integrating a heatmap at its terminal nodes.
Let's explore the package **treeheatr** a little deeper and see what it can do!


```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(treeheatr)
library(dplyr)
library(cowplot)
```

## Let's begin

with the iris dataset!
Running the `heat_tree()` function can be as simple as:

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
dat_raw <- iris
heat_tree(dat_raw, target_lab = 'Species') %>% 
  grid::grid.draw()
```

But we can adjust a few graphical parameters.
We can also add a custom layout for a subset of the nodes by specifying it in the `custom_layout` parameter.
And we can relax the p value threshold `p_thres` to include more features that might be less important in classifying the samples but still included in the decision tree, or set `show_all_feats = TRUE` to include all features, even the ones that were not used to build the tree.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=7}
heat_tree(
  dat_raw, target_lab = 'Species',
  target_cols = scale_fill_manual(values = c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73")),
  custom_layout = data.frame(id = 1, x = 0.1, y = 1), show_all_feats = TRUE,
  panel_space = 0.05, target_space = 0.2, tree_space_bottom = 0.1, heat_rel_height = 0.4) %>% 
  grid::grid.draw()
```

We can also customize our heattree by passing parameters through to different **ggparty** geoms.
These list parameters are named `*_vars`.
For example:

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
heat_tree(
  dat_raw, target_lab = 'Species',
  par_node_vars = list(
    label.size = 0.2,
    label.padding = unit(0.1, "lines"),
    line_list = list(
      aes(label = paste("Node", id)),
      aes(label = splitvar),
      aes(label = paste("p =", formatC(p.value, format = "e", digits = 2)))),
    line_gpar = list(
      list(size = 8),
      list(size = 8),
      list(size = 6)),
    id = 'inner'),
  terminal_vars = list(size = 0),
  edge_vars = list(size = 1, color = 'grey')) %>% 
  grid::grid.draw()
```

## Some more examples

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
heat_tree(wine, target_lab = 'Type', target_lab_disp = 'Cultivar') %>% 
  grid::grid.draw()
```

```{r warning=F, fig.height=7, fig.width=7}
p <- lapply(
  list(flags, saheart, diabetes), 
  heat_tree, 
  target_lab = 'target', 
  target_lab_disp = '',
  heat_rel_height = 0.4, tree_space_bottom = 0.1, 
  terminal_vars = list(label.padding = unit(0.1, "lines"), size = 3, color = 'white'))

cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = p, ncol = 1)
```


## Smart node layout

These extreme visualizations may not be very interpretable but serves the purpose of showing the ability to generalize of the node layout when the tree grows in size.
The implemented smart layout weighs the x-position of the parent node according to the level of the child nodes as to avoid crossing of tree branches.
This relative weight can be adjusted with the `lev_fac` parameter in `heat_tree()`.
The default `lev_fac = 1.3` seems to provide aesthetically pleasing trees, independent of the tree size.

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=9}
# waveform has 5000 observations and 40 features
# so this computation may take up to a minute or two.

heat_tree(waveform, target_lab = 'target', heat_rel_height = 0.35) %>%
  grid::grid.draw()
```

In this next figure, on the top, `lev_fac = 1` makes parent node perfectly in the middle of child nodes (note a few branch crossing), which contrasts `lev_fac = 1.3` (default) on the bottom.

```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=9, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cowplot::plot_grid(
  heat_tree(wine_quality_red, target_lab = 'target', lev_fac = 1),
  heat_tree(wine_quality_red, target_lab = 'target'),
  ncol = 1,
  labels = c('lev_fac = 1', 'lev_fac = 1.3'))
```

## Clustering

Unless you turn it off (`clust_feats = FALSE`, `clust_samps = FALSE`), **treeheatr** automatically performs clustering when organizing the heatmap.
To order the features, clustering is run on the two groups of features, continuous and categorical, across all samples (including the class label, unless `clust_class = FALSE`).
To order the samples, clustering is run on samples within each terminal node of all features (not only the displayed features).
**treeheatr** uses `cluster::daisy()` with the Gower metric to incorporate both continuous and nominal categorical feature types.
Now, `cluster::daisy()` may throw this warning if your dataset contains binary features:

```binary variable(s) treated as interval scaled```

but in general this is safe to ignore because the goal of clustering is to improve our interpretability of the tree-based model and not to make precise inference about each cluster.

## Mixed data types

**treeheatr** supports mixed data types.

For continuous variables, we can choose to either *scale* (subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) or *normalize* (subtract the min and divide by the max) each variable.
Depending on what we want to show in the heatmap, one transformation method can be more effective than the other.
Details on the strengths and weaknesses of different types of data transformation for heatmap display can be found in [this vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/package=heatmaply/vignettes/heatmaply.html#data-transformation-scaling-normalize-and-percentize) of the **heatmaply** package.

Let's take a closer look at how it handles a dataset like Titanic with categorical variables (`Class`, `Sex`, `Embarked`) and continuous variables (others).
We **highly recommend** that, when dealing with mixed data types, the user supply `feat_types` to indicate whether a feature should be considered 'numeric' (continuous) or 'factor' (categorical) as shown below.
When `feat_types` is not specified, **treeheatr** automatically inferred each column type from the original dataset.

```{r fig.height=4.5, fig.width=9}
dat_raw <- titanic %>%
  dplyr::select(Survived, Sex, Pclass, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked) 

heat_tree(
  dat_raw,
  target_lab = 'Survived',
  label_map = c(`1` = 'Survived', `0` = 'Deceased'),
  feat_types = c(Pclass = 'factor',
                 Sex = 'factor',
                 Age = 'numeric',
                 SibSp = 'numeric',
                 Parch = 'numeric',
                 Fare = 'numeric',
                 Embarked = 'factor')) %>% 
  grid::grid.draw()
```


## Regression

In general, compared to classification, regression task is more difficult to interpret with a decision tree.
However, a heatmap may shed some light on how the tree groups the samples in different terminal nodes.
Also, removing the terminal node label may show the groups better.
Here are a few examples:


```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
heat_tree(data = galaxy,
          target_lab = 'target',
          task = 'regression',
          terminal_vars = NULL,
          tree_space_bottom = 0) %>%
  grid::grid.draw()
```


For illustration purposes, we're only showing the top 300 samples of the *pollen* dataset below.

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
heat_tree(data = pollen[1:300, ],
          target_lab = 'target',
          task = 'regression') %>%
  grid::grid.draw()
```
